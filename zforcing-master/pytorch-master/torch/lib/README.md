This directory contains the low-level tensor libraries for PyTorch.
This code traces its lineage from the original Torch.  There are
multiple variants of the library, summarized here:

* TH = TorcH
* THC = TorcH Cuda
* THCS = TorcH Cuda Sparse
* THCUNN = TorcH CUda Neural Network (see cunn)
* THD = TorcH Distributed
* THNN = TorcH Neural Network
* THPP = TorcH C++ (note: this library is not the same as https://github.com/facebook/thpp, but rather a standalone C++ wrapper of Torch Tensors)
* THS = TorcH Sparse

(You'll also see these abbreviations show up in symbol names.)
